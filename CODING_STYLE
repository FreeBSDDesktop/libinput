- Indentation in tabs, 8 characters wide, spaces after the tabs where
  vertical alignment is required (see below)

- Max line width 80ch, do not break up printed strings though

- Break up long lines at logical groupings, one line for each logical group

  int a = somelongname() +
  	  someotherlongname();

  if (a < 0 &&
      (b > 20 & d < 10) &&
      d != 0.0)


  somelongfunctioncall(arg1,
  		       arg2,
  		       arg3);

- Function declarations: return type on separate line, {} on separate line,
  arguments broken up as above.

  static inline int
  foobar(int a, int b)
  {

  }

  void
  somenamethatiswaytoolong(int a,
  			   int b,
  			   int c)
  {
  }

- /* comments only */, no // comments

- variable_name, not VariableName or variableName. same for functions.

- no typedefs of structs, enums, unions

- if it generates a compiler warning, it needs to be fixed
- if it generates a static checker warning, it needs to be fixed or
  commented

- declare variables at the top, try to keep them as local as possible.
  Exception: if the same variable is re-used in multiple blocks, declare it
  at the top.

  int a;
  int c;

  if (foo) {
  	int b;

  	c = get_value();
  	usevalue(c);
  }

  if (bar) {
  	c = get_value();
  	useit(c);
  }

- public functions MUST be doxygen-commented, use doxygen's @foo rather than
  \foo notation

- include "config.h" comes first, followed by system headers, followed by
  external library headers, followed by internal headers.
  sort alphabetically where it makes sense (specifically system headers)

  #include "config.h"

  #include <stdio.h>
  #include <string.h>

  #include <libevdev/libevdev.h>

  #include "libinput-private.h"
